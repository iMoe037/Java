# Java
My first time learning how to program back in 2011!

Fresh out of high school, this was my first attempt at programming. With an intro to Java in college this repo contains my class/home work from the fourth editon of Starting out With Java by Tony Gaddis. Looking at this code 5 years later, what the hell was I thinking when I wrote this code? Almost no use of comments, lots and lots of repeated code, and going crazy with variable assignments.
